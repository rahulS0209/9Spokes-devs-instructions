Segment Implementation

We are going to implement Segment (Customer Data Platform) for 9Spokes to track what’s happening on the Dashboard website. This consolidated data will be used for Web and Data analysis to enhance the customer service, experience and journey.

Initially, in this first phase, we are incorporating Segment with 9Spokes Dashboard websites.

To do so, please kindly follow the below instructions.

To install Segment just copy and paste the below Javascript snippet into the <head> tag as high as you can on all the web pages of the 9Spokes Dashboard website. 

9Spokes Dashboard webpages are all the pages starting with domain https://dashboard.9spokes.com/.This includes the Homepage, Track, Connect and Explore pages and subpages.
